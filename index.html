<body>
    ## <bold>ZeroX Privacy Policy</bold> <br><br>
    ### By using ZeroX Bot, you agree with its privacy policy. <br>
    <br>
    ## 1. What does it store?
    - Server IDs for servers data (automod punishments, etc)
    - User IDs for user data (whitelisting user)
    <br>
    ## 2. Who can access the data?
    <br>
    #### 1. Following people can access ALL of the data:
    -  Bot developer(s)
    <br>
    #### 2. Following people can access whitelist:
    - Server Owner
    <br>
    #### 3. Following people can access Warns:
    - Server Admin(s)
    <br> <br>
    ## 3. How can I get rid of the data stored? 
    <br>
    #### 1. To clear a user id from the whitelist, do one of the following:
    - Ask the server owner to unwhitelist you.
    - re-add the bot to the server, as it removed all guild data from the database when you remove it.
    <br>
    <br>
    ## 4. Why do we store the data?
    <br>
    #### 1. It stores server IDs for settings and data because:
    - We need servers ids to store user ids under them for  mutes, etc
    <br>
    #### 2. It stores user IDs for whitelisting, warns:
    - We need the user ids to know if the user is whitelisted or not.
    <br>
    #### 3. It stores server IDs and user IDs for blacklist because:
    - We Sometimes have to block a guild or a user from using the bot, if they do not follow the bot rules.

    <br>
    ## 5. I'm questioning why do you need all this data, and this Privacy Policy doesn't answer my question. What   should I do?
    <br>
